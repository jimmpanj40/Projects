notes:
 - To show an image I, use imagesc rather than imshow.
   When using imshow(I), if I is of type float, the value <=0 will be shown black, while the value >=1 will be show white and you can not see many things. 
   Solutions : 
        1) normalise I before using imshow 
        2) imshow(I,[]) -> automatic normalization

 - For the JPEG project, it is not necessary to split your image “physically” into different blocks. If you store the image as a table of blocks, you may need a table of four indices, two for block indices within the image and two for pixel indices within the block. 
   Advice : try an other way

 - For the JPEG project, to compute the compression rate, at the first time, you can consider only the number of variables being stored after each step.
   For example, at the beginning, you need to store 500*500 = 250000 values of 1byte. Once the RLC is done, you may need to store only 60000 values of 1byte. 
	So the rate here is 250000/60000.
   When Huffman is used, you consider also the size of the dictionary.
